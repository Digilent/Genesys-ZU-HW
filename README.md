# Genesys ZU-3EG Hardware Repository

**Important!** *This repository is under construction. Many master branches do not yet exist, and many links to the Digilent wiki may point to under construction pages.*

This repository contains the Vivado projects and hardware designs for all of the demos that we provide for the Genesys ZU-3EG, across multiple tools. As some demos also require software sources contained in Vitis workspaces, this repository should not be used directly. The [Genesys ZU](https://github.com/Digilent/Genesys-ZU) repository contains all sources for these demos across all tools, and pulls in all of this repository's sources by using it as a submodule.

For additional documentation on individual demos, and for instructions on how to use them with your Genesys ZU-3EG, visit their pages on the Digilent Wiki, linked below.

For instructions on how to use this repository with git, and for additional documentation on the submodule and branch structures used, please visit [Digilent FPGA Demo Git Repositories](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/documents/git) on the Digilent Wiki. Note that use of git is not required to use this demo. Digilent recommends the use of project releases, for which instructions can be found in each demo wiki page, linked in the table of demos, above.
