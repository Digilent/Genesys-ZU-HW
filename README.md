# Genesys-ZU Hardware Repository

This repository contains Vivado projects for all demos for the Genesys-ZU.

For more information about the Genesys-ZU, visit its [Resource Center](https://reference.digilentinc.com/programmable-logic/genesys-zu/start) on the Digilent Wiki.

## Repository Description

This repository contains the Vivado projects and hardware designs for all of the demos that we provide for the Genesys-ZU. As some demos also require software sources contained in Vitis workspaces, this repository should not be used directly. The [Genesys-ZU](https://github.com/Digilent/Genesys-ZU) repository contains all sources for these demos across all tools, and pulls in all of this repository's sources by using it as a submodule.

For instructions on how to use this repository with git, and for additional documentation on the submodule and branch structures used, please visit [Digilent FPGA Demo Git Repositories](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/documents/git) on the Digilent Wiki. Note that use of git is not required to use this demo.
