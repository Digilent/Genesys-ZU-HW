# Genesys ZU-5EV Hardware Repository

## Genesys ZU-5EV Out-of-Box Demo

For more information on the Genesys ZU-5EV, see its [Resource Center](https://reference.digilentinc.com/programmable-logic/genesys-zu/start) on the Digilent Wiki.

For more information on the Genesys ZU-5EV OOB Demo, including setup instructions, visit its [Demo Page](https://reference.digilentinc.com/programmable-logic/genesys-zu/getting-started) on the Digilent Wiki.

For instructions on how to use this repository with git, and for additional documentation on the submodule and branch structures used, please visit [Digilent FPGA Demo Git Repositories](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/documents/git) on the Digilent Wiki. Note that use of git is not required to use this demo. Digilent recommends the use of project releases, for which instructions can be found in the demo wiki page, linked above.

Note: If using git, as this demo requires sources for tools other than Vivado, which are provided in other repos, it is recommended to get these sources through the corresponding branch of the  Genesys ZU repository, which uses submodules to bring in sources for all tools used by this demo. This is described in the Digilent FPGA Demo Git Repositories page, linked above.
